## commands
**!checkdmg** - View damage output of currently wielded weapon/staff/fists.

**!bestwep** - Outputs a rankings list of each weapon in your inventory and on the floor under you. Calculates damage vs an opponent with 1 AC and 6 EV who is not immune or resistant to your weapon's brand. In the dungeon, these are called ogres.
